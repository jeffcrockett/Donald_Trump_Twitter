permalinkembedsaveparentreportgive goldreply[–]istinetz [vw] 6 points7 points8 points 25 minutes ago (2 children)if it's a bot, it should post more and more consistently than any human could. I'm betting on a bamboozle though, AI is not this far along.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportgive goldreply[–]dacota198 [vw] 0 points1 point2 points 8 minutes ago (1 child)You know there's a cool down for replying. Right? I doubt even a bot could surpass that.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportgive goldreply[–]istinetz [vw] 2 points3 points4 points 6 minutes ago (0 children)I am aware. It looks to be posting about twice a minute now. If it sustains that tempo for a week, that would be sufficient evidence for me that it's a bot, not a person or a group of people.

EDIT: nevermind, it has already slowed down.
